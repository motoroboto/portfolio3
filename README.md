This is an updated portfolio page. It is built using React, and features a sleak design that showcases some of my recent projects as well as links to my resume and my various professional sites. It features header and footer elements that are used on multiple pages, and navigation is handled via React Router. It has been deployed to GitHub pages and it can be viewed here:
